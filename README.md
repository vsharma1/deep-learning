# Deep Learning Projects
My personal deep learning repository for side projects / Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) program, each project contains notebook with code and a readme
files.

# Projects

* First Neural Network: Implement a neural network in Numpy to predict bike rentals.
* Image classification: Build a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify CIFAR-10 images.
* Text Generation: Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.
* Machine Translation: Train a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset)
* Face Generation: Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate
images of novel and realistic human faces.
