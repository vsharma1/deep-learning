# Deep Learning Projects
My personal deep learning repository for side projects / Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) program, each project contains notebook with code and a readme
files.

# Projects

* [First Neural Network](https://github.com/vsharma1/deep-learning/tree/master/first-neural-network): Implement a neural network in Numpy to predict bike rentals.
* [Image classification](https://github.com/vsharma1/deep-learning/tree/master/image-classification): Build a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify CIFAR-10 images.
* [Text Generation](https://github.com/vsharma1/deep-learning/tree/master/tv-script-generation): Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.
* [Machine Translation](https://github.com/vsharma1/deep-learning/tree/master/language-translation): Train a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset)
* [Face Generation](https://github.com/vsharma1/deep-learning/tree/master/face-generation): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate
images of novel and realistic human faces.
